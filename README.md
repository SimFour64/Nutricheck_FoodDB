# Analysis of Compound Concentrations in Foods

This project aims to analyze the concentrations of various chemical compounds in different foods. It merges data from multiple CSV files, filters a list of specific compounds, and identifies the top five foods with the highest concentration for each compound.

## Features

- Merge multiple CSV files containing information about foods and compounds.
- Filter compounds based on a provided list.
- Identify the top five foods with the highest concentration for each compound.
- Export the results to a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the input CSV files.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing the Python scripts for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing the Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration.
- `output_files/`: Directory containing the output files generated by the python script.


## Usage

- Ensure that the CSV files `foods.csv`, `compounds.csv`, and `contents.csv` are present in the ``/data`` directory.
- Run the main script to analyze the data and generate the output file:
  ```bash
  python scripts/get_compounds.py
  ```
- The script will generate a CSV file named `compound_food_source_report_{COMPOUND_NAMES}.csv.csv` in the ``output_files`` repository containing the results.
